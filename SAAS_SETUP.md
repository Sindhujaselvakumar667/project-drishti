### Common Issues

#### Maps Not Loading
**Problem**: Map shows gray area or doesn't load
**Solutions**:
1. Check your Google Maps API key in `.env`
2. Ensure Maps JavaScript API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Verify API key restrictions allow your domain
4. Check browser console for specific error messages

#### Location Detection Fails
**Problem**: Can't detect current location
**Solutions**:
1. Allow location permissions in your browser
2. Ensure you're accessing the site via HTTPS in production
3. Fallback to manual location entry if needed

#### Login Issues
**Problem**: Can't log in with test credentials
**Solutions**:
1. Verify you're using exact test credentials (case-sensitive)
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### Address Geocoding Fails
**Problem**: Address not found or incorrect location
**Solutions**:
1. Use more specific addresses (include city, state, country)
2. Try different address formats
3. Use the map selection method instead
4. Check Geocoding API is enabled and has quota

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by opening browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('drishti_debug', 'true');
```

This will show additional logging for:
- Authentication flows
- Map operations
- API calls
- Location services

- Set production Google Maps API key
- Configure domain restrictions
- Update CORS settings if needed

3. **Custom Domain** (Optional):
```bash
firebase hosting:channel:deploy production --expires 30d
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

### API Keys
