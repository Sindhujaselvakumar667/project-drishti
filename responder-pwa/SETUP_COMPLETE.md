- ✅ Install prompt appears in supported browsers
- ✅ Vibration works on mobile devices

## 🎯 Integration with Main Drishti Project

### Ready for Integration
The PWA is configured to work with your existing Drishti project:

1. **Same Firebase Project** (`zero2agent-ffe2e`)
2. **Emergency Collection** ready for Firestore triggers
3. **Cloud Functions** can send notifications to responders
4. **FCM Tokens** stored for targeting specific responders

### Example Integration
```javascript
// In main Drishti app - create emergency
const emergency = {
  location: 'Zone A - Building 42',
  description: 'Fire reported on 3rd floor',
  priority: 'high',
  type: 'fire'
};

// This triggers Cloud Function → sends to PWA
await db.collection('emergencies').add(emergency);
```
