### Background Message Test (Advanced)
If you have the backend integration set up:

1. Send a test message from Firebase Console:
   ```json
   {
     "notification": {
       "title": "üö® Test Emergency",
       "body": "This is a test emergency notification"
     },
     "data": {
       "type": "emergency",
       "location": "Test Zone",
       "priority": "high"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Verify:

## üß™ Integration with Main Drishti Project

### Database Integration Test
If Firestore is set up:

1. Create test emergency in main Drishti app:
   ```javascript
   const testEmergency = {
     location: 'Test Zone - Building 1',
     description: 'Test emergency for PWA integration',
     priority: 'high',
     zone: 'A',
