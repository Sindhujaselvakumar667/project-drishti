# PWA Icons Placeholder

This directory should contain the PWA icons for the Emergency Responder app.

## Required Icons

The following icon sizes are needed for the PWA to work properly:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

## Generating Icons

You can use online tools like:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://favicon.io/

Or use image editing software to create icons with the emergency responder theme (red background, emergency symbol).

## Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can create simple colored square PNG files with the required dimensions, or copy existing icons from other projects.

The PWA will work without these icons, but they improve the user experience when installing the app on mobile devices.
